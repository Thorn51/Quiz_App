This project was developed as a student in the Thinkful Fullstack Flex program. 

Quiz App
The quiz app takes a user through 10 multiple choice questions. It provides the user instant feedback after answering a question. At the end of the quiz the user is provided feedback on results with the option to retake the quiz or choose a different topic. The quiz app is currently a minimum viable product(MVP), but has been designed with future expansion in mind. It is currently configured to quiz users on their knowledge about jQuery with the capability to expand to other front-end development topics, or other topics all together.
